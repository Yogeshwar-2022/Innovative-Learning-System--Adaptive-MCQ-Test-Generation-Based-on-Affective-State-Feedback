# Innovative Learning System: Adaptive MCQ Test Generation Based on Affective State Feedback
This project introduces an innovative learning system that adaptively generates multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on six key cognitive-affective states: engagement, boredom, frustration, confusion, excitement, and confidence. By analyzing these emotional indicators in real time, the system personalizes question difficulty and selection to better match the learner’s current mental state. This approach enhances individualized learning, promotes sustained attention, and improves overall academic performance through emotionally-aware test delivery.
